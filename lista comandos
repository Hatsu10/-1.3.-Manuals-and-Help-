Many Linux programs have built in manuals, also known as man pages. We can use the man command to open up a man page in our terminal window. Generally, each man page will have a name, a synopsis, a description of the command's purpose, and the corresponding options, parameters, or switches.
For example, we can open the man page for ls with the following command:

man ls

Man pages contain information about user commands, and also documentation regarding system administration commands, programming interfaces, and more. Manuals are categorized by several numbered sections.
To determine the appropriate manual section, we can perform a keyword search. For example, let's assume we are interested in learning a bit more about the file format of the /etc/passwd file. Typing man passwd at the command-line will show information regarding the passwd command from section 1 of the manual, which is not what we are interested in.


man passwd.




man -k passwd
man -k '^passwd$'
man 5 passwd
more -h
